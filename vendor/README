The directory vendor contains a set of dependencies from outside sources
that are needed to build various components and tools within Astraea.

Some of these dependencies reside within the Astraea repo, while others are pulled
from other repositories and placed in the vendor/libraries/externals directory
during build. These external dependencies are defined in a .gitmodules file.

Products in vendor are subject to their own respective license terms.
The license for each project should be included in the source itself via a license
header or file. If the source itself does not include a license header or file,
create a README that refers to reliable documentation of the project's license
terms on the web.
